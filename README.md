# WhatsApp_Chat_Analysis


This project is about WhatsApp chat analysis. </br></br>
WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 Billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily and it’s so common everywhere. But as there can be a lot many messages in a chat between group of people, the user will not be able to summarize his/her chats i.e.; it is sometimes difficult to find the total number of texts/chats, emoji’s used, links shared or total number of media in the chat. So in this project we are trying to analyse and summarize the chat between people of a group provided which contains all the parameters required using Python.</br></br>
This project is to analyse our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people. And the data set taken can be any exported WhatsApp chat which should be in the form of a text document. But the data set taken is in the raw form. So firstly the data is being arranged in a data frame manner with all the parameters required in the form of rows and columns and here now by using some Python libraries and algorithms, we will try to summarize the entire chat. Visualization can also be done of the total emoji’s present in the chat and the type of emoji’s sent between the two people and most common words used by individual in the chat by the individual. It will help in understanding the relationship between both the people.
